* [0/1] HTML
** TODO Remove Landmark tests, focus more on CommonMark tests
* [0/1] Tests
** TODO Use passing CommonMark 0.30 tests as baseline
* [0/4] Size
** TODO Shorten variable name 'ref' => 'r'
** TODO Shorten method name 'addRule' to 'add'
** TODO Remove optional trailing HTML tags
   </li>, </p>
** TODO Replaced unnecessary `.*?` with `.*`
   Greediness is fine if anchored by `\n`, since `.` doesn't match newlines.
* [0/7] Features
** TODO Invoke Baremark as `baremark(...)` rather than `Baremark.render(...)`
   Adding a rule should then use `baremark.addRule(regex, repl)`.
** TODO '  \n' should result in '<br>'
   Using something like `[/(\\| {2,})\n/g, '<br>']` (and making sure it doesn't
   interfere with backslash escapes).
** TODO Add comments to code (and include a version stripped of comments)
   There should also exist a git hook to verify that these always are in sync.
** TODO Horizontal line should need only 3 chars
   And may be either _, - or * according to CommonMark standard.
** TODO Hanging indent lists
** TODO Indented code blocks(?)
** TODO Nested lists
* [0/7] Bugs
** TODO Disallow space around headline and code fence markup
   Before `#`, `---` and `===` in headings, and before/after ```.
** TODO Fix `#` headings
   Are broken in Van Tigranyan's original gist.
** TODO Bold, italics and inline code may span newlines
   But never an empty line.
** TODO Bullet must have space after `*` or `-`
   To avoids confusion with italics.
** TODO Blockquotes should be able to contain lists
** TODO Blank line in list/blockquote should start new list/blockquote
** TODO Link/image regex shortening
   Both link and image regex have a needless non-greedy regex.

   /\!\[([^\[]+?)\]\s*\(([^\)]+?)\)/g
   /  \[([^\[]+?)\]\s*\(([^\)]+?)\)/g

               HERE
* Limitations
** Blockquotes can't be nested
** Simplistic paragraph detection with HTML
   Somewhat simplistic insertion of <p> -- it will be added around some HTML
   elements (like <div> and others) which <p> can't contain, so if user uses
   those, you'll get some empty <p> elements in the DOM (before and after those
   block elements).

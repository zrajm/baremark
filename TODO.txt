** TODO Replaced unnecessary `.*?` with `.*`
   Greediness is fine if anchored by `\n`, since `.` doesn't match newlines.
* [0/10] Features
** TODO Add '![text][ref]' image support
** TODO '  \n' should result in '<br>'
   Using something like `[/(\\| {2,})\n/g, '<br>']` (and making sure it doesn't
   interfere with backslash escapes).
** TODO Add comments to code (and include a version stripped of comments)
   There should also exist a git hook to verify that these always are in sync.

   And may be either _, - or * according to CommonMark standard.
** TODO Hanging indent lists

   Content need to be URL encoded. CommonMark example 20 illustrate this.

** TODO Disallow space around headline and code fence markup
   Before `#`, `---` and `===` in headings, and before/after ```.
** TODO Fix `#` headings
   Are broken in Van Tigranyan's original gist.
** TODO Bold, italics and inline code may span newlines
   But never an empty line.

   To avoids confusion with italics.

** TODO Link/image regex shortening
   Both link and image regex have a needless non-greedy regex.

* [22/22] FINISHED
** DONE Improved insertion of <p> tags
   CLOSED: [2024-09-24 Tue 20:30]
   Will no longer insert <p> around the following HTML tags:

     + address
     + article
     + aside
     + blockquote
     + details
     + div
     + dl
     + fieldset
     + figcaption
     + figure
     + footer
     + form
     + h#
     + header
     + hgroup
     + hr
     + main
     + menu
     + nav
     + noscript
     + ol
     + p
     + pre
     + script
     + search
     + section
     + style
     + table
     + ul

   These tags will all result in the end of a paragraph (as an omitted </p> is
   assumed), as explained in the MDN docs for '<p>: The Paragraph element'
   (under 'tag omission')
   https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/p#technical_summary

   A blocklist like this is probably the only ways to achieve this. :(

   The previous statement (below) is thereby hopefully not true any more.
   (Future will tell!)

   "Simplistic paragraph detection with HTML: Somewhat simplistic insertion of
   <p> -- it will be added around some HTML elements (like <div> and others)
   which <p> can't contain, so if user uses those, you'll get some empty <p>
   elements in the DOM (before and after those block elements)."
** DONE Prettier CSS

   <tt> and <pre> should use gray background (a la Github or Stackoverflow).
** DONE Bugfix: Normalize space in reference links (+158 bytes)
   CLOSED: [2024-09-20 Fri 04:03]
   Space in reference links needs to be normalized, so that wrapped lines (or
   multiple spaces) do not break links. That is, this should work:

       Link with too many spaces [some  link], or line break [some other
       link] -- whitespace does not need to match in link references.

       [some
       link]: http://example.com/

       [some  other link
       ]: http://example.com/

   The builtin rules match for one optional newline in the beginning/end of the
   link references. (Since this is shorter than writing a regex that forbids
   space in the beginning/end of the reference.)
** DONE Bugfix: Don't mangle regex flags in user added rules (-15 bytes)
   CLOSED: [2024-09-19 Thu 21:57]
   Previously forced the RegExp flag 'g' by running the first argument of
   `baremark.add()` through `RegExp(p,'g')` which stripped all *other* flags
   off of the regexp! (No good!) Rather than burdening the source with
   additional error checks Baremark now the arguments are now fed as-is into
   the rules array (i.e. when applied, whatever you specify is passed as to
   Javascript's 'String.replace()' function).
** DONE Remove unneeded backslash escapes in regexes
   CLOSED: [2022-09-09 Fri 14:19]
   These superfluous backslash escapes where found by Taco de Wolff's 'minify'
   tool for Javascript: https://go.tacodewolff.nl/minify
** DONE Remove Landmark tests, focus more on CommonMark tests
   CLOSED: [2022-09-09 Fri 14:10]
** DONE Invoke Baremark as `baremark(...)` rather than `Baremark.render(...)`
   CLOSED: [2022-09-09 Fri 12:34]
   Adding a rule should then use `baremark.add(regex, repl)`.
